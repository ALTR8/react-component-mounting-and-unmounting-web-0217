# React: Component Mounting and Unmounting

## Objectives

1. Describe what happens in the mounting phase of a React component's lifecycle
2. Describe what happens in the unmounting phase of a React component's
   lifecycle

## Overview

This lesson is a deep dive into the mounting and unmounting phases; we'll deal
with rendering separately, since it works somewhat differently (in that it
happens over and over again).

It's a good idea to go over when is good to do what (e.g., make AJAX calls for
initial data in `componentDidMount()`, clear timers in `componentWillUnmount()`,
etc.)
